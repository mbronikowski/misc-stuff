GoChile_calibration_stacking.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook for calibrating and stacking data from University of Nova Gorica's GoChile telescope. It utilises astropy and astroalign for frame aligning and stacking. The notebook should be flexible enough to work on other telescope data with minor adjustments. 

Requires the following Python packages: astropy, astroalign, matplotlib, jupyter. Optional for performance improvements: bottleneck.
